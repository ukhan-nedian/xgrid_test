Assumptions:

Url = http:localhost:8080/api/get_products





Blockage:

I neither had the physical device nor emulator running, so I had to write the non-UI code along with unit tests.





Why it was not completed?

Because my laptop was running out of battery and was lagging very much so I had to submit the test.
